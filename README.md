# UI Challenge

Your task is to create a Single Page Application (SPA) using React that displays a list of "Batches"
based on some sample data. A user can click a batch in the list to see the details for that batch.
In a production system, the data for your application would come from a backend server. For this
exercise you should use the sample data provided in this document.

## Requirements

Your SPA should support the following:
1. Display a list of Batches with the following fields:
  - id
  - status

2. Include a control to filter the list to only show batches with a "Succeeded" status
3. Click a Batch in the list to display a Batch Detail page with the following information shown:
  - id
  - status
  - createdBy
  - createdAt
  - labels
